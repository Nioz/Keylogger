This keylogger, when activated, will log: keystrokes, the window the user is currently clicked into, the date/time, and the users public AND private IP address.
It does this by saving the file to a common directory that most/all users have (e.g. Documents, Pictures, etc) directory, 
it will then create a text file with all of the formatted data, email it to the specified email listed in config.py, then it will delete the file. 

The creation of the file in the common directory helps minimize the likelyhood of the file being discovered. 
The deletion of the file helps hide evidence that the user's keystrokes are being logged, and also minimizes computer resources.

To see an example of the formatting of the text file, please see Keylogger0I6614699.txt in the repo.
